# References / resources

The material in this course builds upon several excellent courses, books, and articles on programming and data science. I provide attributions throughout the notes, but want to highlight the following excellent resources:

The courses by Grant McDermott ([EC 607](https://github.com/uo-ec607/)) and Matthew Blackwell ([Gov 50](https://gov50-f23.github.io/)) have been of particular importance in preparing these materials. So have the books by Kieran Healy ([Data visualization](https://socviz.co/)) and Hadley Wickham ([R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) and [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)).
